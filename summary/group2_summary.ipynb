    "Pizza Chains almost speard in every city of North America. Many people are willing to choose pizza as their first choice when they have no idea what to eat. In Module3, we decided to assume Pizza Hut as our object to have analysis. And the other 9 pizza chain restaurants, which are selected by the quantity of the restaurants across the nation, are also analyzed and compared with Pizza Hut. For operators of Pizza Hut, it's important for them to get a full understanding about themselves and their competitors, their own or their competitors' advantages and disadvantsges to improve themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the given data *user.json*, *review.json*, *tip.json* and *business.json*, all of these four datasets contain many variables and obsrvations need to be filtered. So we only kept the observations related to 10 pizza chain brands which have the largest amount of restaurants, defined as \"top 10 pizza chain\".\n",

    "(c) find the nown words adjacent to the selected adjected words to form the **noun-adj pairs**.\n",

    "By scanning through the business.json file, we could identify different kinds of business in the dataset, including finance institutions, restaurants, hair and beauty and so on. Firstly we focused on the restaurant category and there are still many kinds of restaurants such as Chinese restaurants, Japanese restaurants and fast food restaurants. Then zoom in the fast food restuarants and select only the pizza restaurants, we could then count the number of these pizza restaurants in the dataset. Because many pizza brands only have one or several restaurants, we sorted them by the quantity of the restaurants and chose only the top 10,finally we got the object we will study on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we did some basic statistical analysis with these top 10 pizza restaurants. We got the locations of them and identify that based on our dataset, the restaurants are located in 11 states **AB**, **AZ**, **IL**, **NC**, **NV**, **OH**, **ON**, **PA**, **QC**, **SC**, **WI**. Then we first compared the average stars of the top 10 pizza restaurants. Second, we drew the average star for Pizza Hut restaurant to get a overall review.\n"

    "**Introduction** \n",
    "\n",
    "Considered about the fact Yelp is not only a website/mobile app which could show you different business directory and public assessments. To some extent, it is also a social media and a review forum where users are able to communicate with each other. So,it will be likely to think that maybe we tend to believe special classes of users more that others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that you are hungry and want to adopt a restaurant. There are only two users' reviews but you are only able to pick one of them to help you make the decision. The first user has lots of followers and writes many reviews. When you look at his/her files, a large number of different kinds of compliments received by the user. But another one, just like an almost blank account. Which user do you tend to choose? \n",
    "\n",
    "On social media, there is a common phenomenon that people are more likely to choose a restaurant or a product recommended by influential users or active ones. Naturally, we tried to measure users' influence and activeness on the social network. When we are in the face of social network analysis, centrality is one of the concepts studied most. A wealth of methods have found centrality measures to identify special users. Between millions of users, how to measure new definitions we will use later, in other words, how to work with the data to calculate users' weight. Companies like Twitter have diverse measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first, PageRank algorithm came into our views. PageRank algorithm is an effective method which is used to rank websites and there are several measures based on it. But when coming back to browse our users dataset, we could find that this dataset doesn't include user followers' specific information so that it's almost impossible for us to build the network of fellowship between different users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entropy Weight Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "On account of the dataset we only contain finite variables, the entropy weight method is the final choice. In order to include more aspects, review counts, amount of followers, number of useful/funny/cool votes sent by the user, and number of plain/funny/cool compliments received by the user, these measures of activity and influence are able to gain users' weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure of entropy can be expressed in six steps [1]: \n",
    "- Normalized the raw data to eliminate anomalies with different units and scales. Because later we will use logarithm to process data, a special kind of normalization is used here: \n",
    "\n",

    "After selecting the reviews from the top 10 pizza restaurants, altogether 17951 reviews, the first procedure is to match these reviews with the restaurants' name and user weight we computed before. Then we focused on the review text. To begin with, we did translation. It could be identified that there are more than 10 countries' languages (**Afrikaans**,**Danish**,**French**,...**Spanish**). By using the package in python,we translated them all in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we changed each review into sentences and deleted those sentences contain 'if' in them, because these conditional sentences are usually virtual and cannot correctly present the current situation of the restaurant. These '**if**' sentences are the first direct suggestions we could get from the customers. Next, by removing positive helping verbs, changing sentence pattern ('**not only, but also**' -- '**...and ...**'), extending negative abbreviation('**don't**--**do not**'), combining adverbs with words behind them ('**not great**'-- '**notgreat**'),deleting punctuation marks, deleting positive helping verbs again and combining negative patterns again further ('**not great pizza**' -- '**notgreatpizza**'), we condensed the review text.\n",

We could get a list of adjectives(adv). Then after counting these words throughout the reviews and sorting them, we chose first 50 words with higher frequency and formed a list called adjective vocabulary list. Similarly we formed a vocabulary list that contained 50 tokenized negative phrases ('**neveragain**','**notgreatpizza**')  as not vocabulary list. Combining these two lists and we got a vocabulary with 100 words. Then, we could construct a 17951* 100 matrix **X**, the ijth entry represents the frequency of the jth word in the ith review. The **y** labels are just the star of each review.\n",
